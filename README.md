As we all know the economic impact of natural disasters can run into billions and insurance policies are a great way to minimise personal losses. Typical homeowners insurance policies offer coverage for damage caused by fires, lightning strikes, windstorms and hail. But, it's important to know that not all natural disasters are covered by homeowners insurance. Not only that but about 5% of the people in india opt for a homeowners insurance.
The others :
  66% say it’s just too expensive for them.
  66% say other financial priorities take higher precedence.
  54% feel they have as much as they need right now.
 
The reason insurance companies don’t cover all natural disasters is because they will be forced to shell huge reimbursements when a natural disaster occurs. All this is largely due to the fact that insurance firms don’t estimate the extent to which an individual is prone to such occurrences and issue common policies based on intrinsic properties like health(for life) and market value(for property).
Well, we would like to approach this problem from the customer’s point of view. Looking at the market segment, there is a genuine dearth of insurance options for victims of these natural disasters.Its funny how these days, we can get insurance to cover almost everything. Yet, we can’t get it to cover the single most life-changing disaster and we want to set this straight.
Our new age insurance policy provides users a wide array of policies based on the most effectively and smartly designed premium plans created by a dynamic model tailored to suit the customer’s certain needs and preferences. A core part of our analysis includes comparing 2 datasets. One of which contains the geography of the customers’ surrounding and another which contains the areas most prone to natural disasters. 
ML and AI makes use of past and present seismic, meteorological and other important data to create a function based on parameters like region, past occurrences of disasters, losses incurred, people affected and such and thus helps design the optimum policy. Our model will predict the extent to which the customer will be affected by these different ‘acts of God’ and hence predict an insurance plan for him with an appropriate premium.
This also is made keeping in mind a sustainable structure for the investment of acquired capital so as to have a safe and possible path to return of premium to the customers and endure the company in profit on a long term.
